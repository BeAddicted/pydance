CURRENT FEATURE/BUGLIST TODO (some from mightyflo and prozzy):

clean up progress bar with the prerender/etc.
option for classic or new (pyddr/ddrmax) judging style on jumps
jump to song
refresh songlist / preload from list
sort songlist by playcount
high scores (locally and globally)
keypad for playing? (mappable keys)
lesson mode
nonstop / endless
shuffle (images and arrows)
mirror
local and networked multiplayer
5/8/9panel
MODULARIZE
credits screen / menus

UNDERSTANDING THE SOURCE

res 640x480 (fullscreen adjustable?)

arrows 64x64: 512W with 12Wx8 gaps: 608. 32W gap in center.

arrow gfx filenaming convention:
arr_X_TYPE_FRAME, where TYPE is direction (L,D,U,R) and X is
  N: normal
  S: stepped on
  C: colored

FRAME is 0123 for normal/stepped for arrow pulsing, or 012 for colors

status of arrows:

arrstat(x,y,z) = status where status is:
  0 = no status / not initialised
  1 = is shown (if game is in "sudden" or something, this will help)
  2 = has pulse (to beat)
  4 = has step (they hit this arrow)
  8 = is an arrow (blue 4ths, red 8ths, green 16ths - autocalc'ed)
 16 = 
 32 = 
 64 = hold end
128 = hold begin

x = 0,1,2,3 = l,d,u,r
y = row position (0 = top)
z = player (1 left, 2 right)
toparrows are still in arrstat (y=0)

things important for STEP files:
* beat / 8th / 16th
* bpm 
* change of bpm
* group/file/songname
* multiple levels
- multiple players
* song / ready start points, time
- how to play parts of song (fadein, just play, fadeout?)
* lyrics
* backgrounds, video
- version number
- 

lyrics should be pretty easy; just put the lyrics in after the steps and 
read them in or something

bpm changes? well, they're sort of there, but the hold arrows are buggy

current grading is based on 10-point scale:
amount of perfects and greats:
 100%  !!  all perfect
 100%  SSS < 8% greats; > 92% perfect
 100%  SS  more perfects than greats
 100%  S   more greats than perfects
  90%  A   (ok 8%,  crappy 6%,  shit 4%,  miss 2%)
  80%  B   (ok 16%, crappy 12%, shit 8%,  miss 4%)
  70%  C   (ok 24%, crappy 18%, shit 12%, miss 6%)
  60%  D   (ok 32%, crappy 24%, shit 16%, miss 8%)
worse  F

NEAT STUFF I CAN TRY:

<ShredWheat> pixels = pygame.surfarray.pixels2d(image)
<ShredWheat> pixels ^= pygame.surfarray.pixels2d(alpha_image)

<ShredWheat> img_array = pygame.surfarray.pixels3d(img)
<ShredWheat> img_array[...,0] = img_array[...,2] = img_array[...,1]

STUFF ANNOUNCER SHOULD SAY
--------------------------
<hardcore`> "Awful dancing, you dance like gaijin"
<hardcore`> "get off the mat, there are crippled people waiting to put you 
to shame"
<Futility> "You shame your ancestors with that feeble twitching!"
<hardcore`> "Are you awake, you suck at dancing"  "Are your legs broken?"
<ShredWheat> "stick to programming!"
<ShredWheat> "don't quit that day job"
<Futility> Hehe. "All your peers dance better than you! You are no better 
than a white person!"
