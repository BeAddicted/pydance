    <h1>About pyDDR</h1>
    <p>pyDDR is a dancing simulator, primarily for GNU/Linux, but it also
      runs on other UNIX-like operating systems, Windows, and MacOS
      X. DDR stands for "Dance Dance Revolution", a game that's slowly
      earning popularity in the  United States and other countries,
      that comes from Japan. The game idea is simple. There's a mat with
      four directional arrows  you can step on, and the game scrolls
      arrows up the screen while playing a song. When the arrows reach
      the top of the screen (not sooner and not later, since they pass
      over stationary arrows), you hit the corresponding arrow on the
      pad, and given that you hit it on time with the beat, you score
      points. The idea is that the game is supposed to either teach you
      to dance, or simulate dancing. It works to a degree. =]</p>
    <p>However, if you're just hearing about this game (or cheap), you
      don't actually <em>need</em> a mat to play pyDDR (although it
      definitely makes it more fun). You can use a keyboard or regular
      joystick instead.</p>
    <p>This document assumes you've managed to install pyDDR already.
      If not, you might want to look at the INSTALL file included with
      the source.</p>
    <!-- FIXME - we should have install documentation in here -->
    <h1>Playing pyDDR</h1>
    <p>To play the game, just select "Play Game" from the menu and select
      a song. Press j and l to change your difficulty setting
    (more bars means more difficult). Hit enter when you're on a
    difficulty and song you like.</p>
    <p>Oh wait, now there's all these arrows scrolling up the screen -
    what should you do? Actually, it's pretty simple. When the arrows
    get to the top (which is in time with the music), step on the
    direction of the arrow on your pad. If you're using the keyboard,
    you can just IJKL for up/down/left/right.</p>
    <p>If you want to play a versus game, just hit start on the second
    player's joystick (or '2' on the keyboard). The second player uses
    the arrow keys.</p>
    <p>If you need to exit the game or back out of menus, just press
    escape.</p>
    <h1>Configuring pyDDR</h1>
    <p>The easy way to configure pyDDR is to use the in-game
    configuration menus. Just select the menu item you want to change
    and hit enter or left and right. If you need more precise
    configuration, read on.</p>
    <p>pyDDR reads from configuration files in appropriate
    places. This means <tt>/etc/pyddr.cfg</tt> and
    <tt>~/.pyddr/pyddr.cfg</tt> on UNIX,
    <tt>/Library/Preferences/pyDDR/pyddr.cfg</tt> and
    <tt>~/Library/Preferences/pyDDR/pyddr.cfg</tt> on MacOS X, and
      <tt>pyddr.cfg</tt> in the current directory on all platforms
    (note that this is the only configuration file Windows systems
    will read). Files are read in the order listed above.</p>
    <h2>Adding Songs</h2>
    <p>To add songs, you just need to put the .step file, music file,
    and (if they exist) background and banner files into one of your
    song directories. This is the <tt>songdir</tt> configuration
    variable. On POSIX systems this is /usr/share/games/pyddr/songs,
    /usr/local/share/games/pyddr/songs, and ~/.pyddr/songs. On
    Windows, this is anywhere in the directory pyDDR was installed
    in.</p>
    <!-- FIXME - adding themes -->
    <h2>pyddr.cfg</h2>
    <p>There's a ton of options for this program, most of them with
    confusing names. A complete (as of sometime between 0.6.1 and
    0.6.2) list follows.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay Options</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>arrowcolors 1|2|3|4</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally there are three colors of arrows; one for
      on-beat (quarter notes), one for exactly off-beat (eighth
      notes), and one for all other kinds (16th, 24th, and so on). If
      you change this option, you will only see limited
      colors, which can make the game much harder.</p></dd>

      <dt>assist 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>In this mode, pyDDR will play a sound when you are
      supposed to hit an arrow. It's useful if you can't see the
      screen, or need help getting on beat in a particular
      song.</p></dd>

      <dt>autofail 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is turned off, the game will continue, even when
      your lifebar runs out.</p></dd>

      <dt>badknees 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>If you have trouble with jumps (two arrows at once), you
      can turn this option on to change jumps to one regular
      arrow.</p></dd>

      <dt>grading 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>pyDDR will normally display a grade at the end of every
      song. Turning this option off will bring you back to the song
      selector instead.</p></dd>

      <dt>hidden [num] (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>This makes arrows fade out when they are a certain
      number of beats before the top arrows. You do, however, still
      have to hit them. :)</p></dd>

      <dt>little 0|1|2|3 (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>If you want to try a harder song but want simpler steps,
      you can set this option. 1 removes 16th notes from the song, 2
      removes 8th notes, and 3 removes 16th and 8th notes.</p></dd>

      <dt>lowestcombo [num] (default 4)</dt>
      <dd><p>The number of greats, perfects, or marvelouses you need
      in a row before it begins to count as a "combo" (which affects
      scoring and judging).</p></dd>

      <dt>reversescroll 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally arrows scroll from bottom to top. If this is on,
      they will scroll from top to bottom.</p></dd>

      <dt>scrollspeed [num] (default 1.0)</dt>
      <dd><p>You can use this to make the arrows scroll faster or
      slower (which changes how many are on the screen at any time and
      the spacing between them). It can be a fractional value, like
      0.5 or 1.33.</p></dd>

      <dt>showtoparrows 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>This removes the visual aid of the arrows at the top,
      making you pay more attention to the beat of the music.</p></dd>

      <dt>sudden [num] (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>This makes arrows appear only after they are a certain
      number of beats up the screen. It's the opposite of hidden.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Graphical Options</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>arrowspin 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>If this option is on, the arrows will spin around in
      circles as they go up the screen.</p></dd>

      <dt>arrowscale [num] (default 1)</dt>
      <dd><p>Arrows normally stay the same size as they go up the
      screen. This option makes them shrink (if it's less than 1) or
      grow (if it's more than 1).</p></dd>

      <dt>bgbrightness [num] (default 127)</dt>
      <dd><p>This option determines how bright the background during
      the song is. Higher numbers mean a brighter background.</p></dd>

      <dt>explodestyle [0|1|2|3] (default 3)</dt>
      <dd><p>pyDDR usually displays an effect if you successfully hit an
      arrow, rotating and scaling the arrow at the top. If this is too
      CPU intensive (or you just don't like it), you can set it to 0
      for no effect, 1 for rotating, 2 for scaling, and 3 for rotating
      and scaling.</p></dd>

      <dt>fpsdisplay 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is on pyDDR will display an FPS counter in the
      corner. See the FAQ for what to do if your FPS is very
      low.</p></dd>

      <dt>gfxtheme [themename]</dt>
      <dd><p>Sets your graphical theme (affecting the look of the arrows
      and your lifebar). pyDDR comes with the 'classic' and 'bryan'
      themes. More themes can be installed by putting them in your
      <tt>themes/gfx</tt> directory.</p></dd>

      <dt>lyriccolor [color] (default cyan)</dt>
      <dd><p>Set the color that lyrics appear in. Possible values are
      cyan, aqua, yellow, white, black, red, purple, or orange.</p></dd>

      <dt>showbackground 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Many songs in pyDDR and other dancing games have a
      background image that displays when you play them; however, this
      can make the game slightly slower. If you're desperate for more
      frames, try turning this off to remove the background.</p></dd>

      <dt>showcombo 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally when you get a combo, pyDDR will display your
      current combo length on the screen. Turning this off will remove
      that display.</p></dd>

      <dt>showlyrics 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Some songs have lyrics or other text that will appear at
      the bottom of the screen. Turning this off will remove those
      lyrics.</p></dd>

      <dt>stickycombo 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is off, your combo is erased from the screen
      after a period of time, even if you don't miss an
      arrow.</p></dd>

      <dt>stickyjudge 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>This is like stickycombo, but for judgings (good,
      marvelous, and so on), rather than your combo.</p></dd>

      <dt>totaljudgings [num] (default 1)</dt>
      <dd><p>This many judgings will be displayed on the screen at a
      time.</p></dd>

      <dt>transcolor [color] (default aqua)</dt>
      <dd><p>The color of the second line of lyrics (the "translated"
      line). Possible colors are the same as the ones for the
      lyriccolor option.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Sound Options</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>djtheme [themename]</dt>
      <dd><p>Sets your announcer theme. By default pyDDR comes with
      the 'none' theme (no announcer). Copies from the official
      website also have a 'mrt' theme, which is not distributed with
      various other packages for legal reasons. The pyDDR development
      team is looking for people willing to do voice acting for free
      announcer samples! New themes can be installed in
      <tt>themes/dj</tt>.</p></dd>

      <dt>masteroffset [num] (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>Some systems have speakers or displays that take
	  measurable time (in terms of affecting gameplay) to output a
	  signal. If you have one of these, you can add an offset in
      milliseconds to every song you have.</p>
	<p>This should not be used if you have a lot of step files
      that are a specific number of milliseconds off. If you use it
      for this, all new files you get will be wrong, and no one else
      will be able to use your original files.</p></dd>

      <dt>mixerclock 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Setting this to 0 will make pyDDR use the system clock
      instead of SDL's internal timing functions. This can lead to
      drift between the position in the song and the arrows
      displayed.</p></dd>

      <dt>onboardaudio 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Some systems (especially laptops) use sound cards that
      resample sound in really stupid ways, which may make pyDDR play
      songs such that they "drift" in relation to the steps. If you
      seem to be having drifting issues in all the songs you play, you
      should try turning this on.</p></dd>

      <dt>previewmusic 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is on, the song selection screen will play a
      brief sound clip from the middle of the song when you move the
      selector over it.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Interface Options</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>keyboard qwerty|rqwerty|dvorak|rdvorak</dt>
      <dd><p>Your keyboard type. 'ijkl', while convenient on qwerty
      (standard) keyboards, doesn't work at all on dvorak
      ones. Setting this option to dvorak will redefine your keys to
      'chtn'. The "r" variants swap controls (so player 1 uses the
      arrows, and player 2 uses the letters).</p></dd>

      <dt>sortmode 0|1|2|3|4|5 (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>This sets the sorting mode for the song select screen. 0
      sorts by filename, 1 by song name, 2 by artist name, 3 by BPM, 4
      by difficulty, and 5 by mix.</p>
      <p>This can also be changed by pressing 's' on the song select
      screen.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>System Options</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>songdir [dir1:dir2:dir] (or on Windows, dir1;dir2;dir3)</dt>
      <dd><p>This is a list of directories where pyDDR should look for
      songs (.step files, backgrounds and banners, and the audio
      itself). Generally installing pyDDR gives you a system-wide
      location to place songs (that all users will have access to),
      and a local one in your home directory.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Obscure Options</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>strobe 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Turning this on results in a little blinking light in the
      bottom right corner of the screen. With various light detection
      equipment, this can be used to make pyDDR communicate with a
      strobe lighting system.</p></dd>

      <dt>vesacompat 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>This makes pyDDR (try to) work with the old, buggy, obsolete
	  SVGAlib library and drivers on UNIX.</p></dd>
    </dl>
