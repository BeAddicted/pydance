    <h1>About pydance</h1>
    <p>pydance is a dancing simulator, primarily for GNU/Linux, but it also
      runs on other UNIX-like operating systems, Windows, and Mac OS
      X. The basic game idea is simple. There's a mat with
      directional arrows  you can step on, and the game scrolls
      arrows up the screen while playing a song. When the arrows reach
      the top of the screen (not sooner and not later, since they pass
      over stationary arrows), you hit the corresponding arrow on the
      pad, and given that you hit it on time with the beat, you score
      points. The idea is that the game is supposed to either teach you
      to dance, or simulate dancing. It works to a degree. =]</p>
<p>There are many different types of games like this, such as Dance Dance
Revolution, Pump It Up, Pop'n Stage, Technomotion, and so on. However, they
all have this same basic pattern in common, and so pydance is capable of
playing many different game modes.</p>
    <p>If you're just hearing about this game (or you're broke), you
      don't actually <em>need</em> a mat to play pydance (although it
      definitely makes it more fun). You can use a keyboard or regular
      joystick instead.</p>
    <p>This document assumes you've managed to install pydance already.
      If not, you might want to look at the INSTALL file included with
      the source.</p>
    <h1>Playing pydance</h1>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>All instructions are given in terms of directions. By default, for
player 1, this means the number pad on a qwerty keyboard, or
uiojklm,. for player 2. "Start" refers to enter, and "select"
refers to tab, or 0 on the numeric pad. If you are using a dvorak
keyboard, or a keyboard without a number pad, you can remap the keys
in Interface Options / Map Keys.
</p>
<p>In addition, unless mapped otherwise, the arrow keys will always
control player 1.</p>

<h2>Starting the Game</h2>
    <p>To play the game, just select "Play Game" from the menu. Use
left, right, and start, to select what directions you want to
use, how many people you want playing, and whether you want to use the
song selector, course selector, or random endless songs. Once in the song
selector, use left and right to select a song, up and down to change your
difficulty, and start to start playing.</p>
    <p>Oh wait, now there's all these arrows scrolling up the screen -
    what should you do? Actually, it's pretty simple. When the arrows
    get to the top (which is in time with the music), step on the
    direction of the arrow on your pad (or press the direction on the
keyboard).</p>
    <p>In the song selector, you can hold down start when selecting
      a song to bring up a screen full of game modifiers, that affect
      how the arrows are displayed. You can also hold down select
      to bring up a second screen of game-wide options, like oni or
      battle mode.</p>
    <p>If you need to exit the game or back out of menus, just press
    escape.</p>
    <h2>Nonstop Mode</h2>
    <p>From the normal song selector you can set up <em>Nonstop
    Mode</em>. Select a song and difficulty you want to play, and
    press up left. That song is now on your nonstop playlist. You
    can add a lot of songs this way, then play them all in succession
    without returning to the song selector. To remove a song, press
    down left.</p>
    <h2>Endless Mode</h2>
    <p>The <em>Endless Mode</em> option on the Play Game menu takes
    you into a different selector. In this one, you can select a
    difficulty (either by name, or by rating), and just keep playing
    until you fail.</p>
    <h1>Configuring pydance</h1>
    <p>The easy way to configure pydance is to use the in-game
    configuration menus. Just select the menu item you want to change
    and hit enter, or left and right. If you need more precise
    configuration, read on.</p>
    <p>pydance reads from configuration files in appropriate
    places. This means <tt>/etc/pydance.cfg</tt> and
    <tt>~/.pydance/pydance.cfg</tt> on POSIX systems like GNU/Linux,
    <tt>/Library/Preferences/pydance/pydance.cfg</tt> and
    <tt>~/Library/Preferences/pydance/pydance.cfg</tt> on Mac OS X, and
      <tt>pydance.cfg</tt> in the current directory on all platforms
    (note that this is the only configuration file Windows systems
    will read). Files are read in the order listed above.</p>
    <h2>Adding Songs</h2>
    <p>To add songs, you just need to put the .dance file, music file,
    and (if they exist) background and banner files into one of your
    song directories. This is the <tt>songdir</tt> configuration
    variable. On POSIX systems this is /usr/share/games/pydance/songs,
    /usr/local/share/games/pydance/songs, and ~/.pydance/songs. On
    Windows, this is anywhere in the directory pydance was installed
    in. On Mac OS X, this is the 'pydance Songs' folder in your Music
    folder. You can change this by editing pydance.cfg.</p>
<p>If your files are .sm, .dwi, or .ksf instead of .dance, then you
have to use a specific directory layout. The files need to go in
<tt>&lt;tsongdir&gt;/Mix Name/Song Name/</tt>. This is a limitation of
the DWI and SM formats.</p>

<h2>Adding Courses</h2>
<p>To add courses, put them in one of the directories in your
"coursedir" configuration variable (replace "songs" with "courses" in
the above examples to find out where this is by default), or a
subdirectory of that directory. In addition, if the file is named
<tt>Course.crs</tt>, then if a file named <tt>Course.png</tt> is
found, it will be displayed with the course in the course selection
screen.</p>

<h2>Adding Graphics</h2>
<p>If you want folders to have banners in the song select (like songs
do), you can put them in a banners directory (replace "songs" in
the examples with "banners", again). Within the banners directory,
create subdirectories like "mix", "title", and "artist". Then, when a
a folder named "Foo" in a display mode is found, it checks
<tt>&lt;banners&gt;/&lt;display_mode&gt;/Foo.png</tt>. For example, if
you want to have a banner associated with the folder "Dancing Stage
MegaMix" when you're sorting by mix, make the image
<tt>&lt;banners&gt;/mix/Dancing Stage MegaMix.png</tt>.</p>

    <h2>pydance.cfg</h2>
    <h3>Gameplay Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>assist 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>In this mode, pydance will play a sound when you are
      supposed to hit an arrow. It's useful if you can't see the
      screen, or need help getting on beat in a particular
      song.</p></dd>

      <dt>autofail 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is turned off, the game will continue, even when
      your lifebars runs out.</p></dd>

<dt>autogen 1|0</dt>
<dd><p>Normally pydance generates steps automatically from the "base"
4 panel modes for other modes (like 6 or 8 panel), if they aren't 
defined for that file. Turning this option off prevents pydance from
doing that. Generally this is a bad idea.</p></dd>

      <dt>grading 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>pydance will normally display a grade at the end of every
      song. Turning this option off will bring you back to the song
      selector immediately instead.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Graphical Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>bgbrightness [num] (default 127)</dt>
      <dd><p>This option determines how bright the background during
      the song is. Higher numbers mean a brighter background.</p></dd>

      <dt>explodestyle [0|1|2|3] (default 3)</dt>
      <dd><p>pydance usually displays an effect if you successfully hit an
      arrow, rotating and scaling the arrow at the top. If this is too
      CPU intensive (or you just don't like it), you can set it to 0
      for no effect, 1 for rotating, 2 for scaling, and 3 for rotating
      and scaling.</p></dd>

      <dt>fpsdisplay 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is on pydance will display an FPS counter in the
      corner, and a timer in the top center. See the FAQ for what to
      do if your FPS is very low.</p></dd>

      <dt>gratuitous 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>This turns on some graphical effects that may slow down the
      game and interface considerably, but look nice.</p></dd>

      <dt>lyriccolor [colors] (default cyan)</dt>
      <dd><p>Set the colors that lyrics appear in. Possible values are
	  cyan, aqua, yellow, white, black, red, purple, or orange. If you
	  list more than one color, separated by /s, other lines of lyrics
will appear in those colors.</p></dd>

      <dt>showbackground 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Many songs in pydance and other dancing games have a
      background image that displays when you play them; however, this
      can make the game slightly slower. If you're desperate for more
      frames, try turning this off to remove the background.</p></dd>

      <dt>showcombo 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally when you get a combo, pydance will display your
      current combo length on the screen. Turning this off will remove
      that display.</p></dd>

      <dt>showlyrics 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Some songs have lyrics or other text that will appear at
      the bottom of the screen. Turning this off will remove those
      lyrics.</p></dd>

      <dt>stickycombo 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is off, your combo is erased from the screen
      after a period of time, even if you don't miss an
      arrow.</p></dd>

      <dt>stickyjudge 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>This is like stickycombo, but for judgings (good,
      marvelous, and so on), rather than your combo.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Sound Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>djtheme [themename]</dt>
      <dd><p>Sets your announcer theme. By default pydance comes with
      the 'none' theme (no announcer). Copies from the official
      website also have a 'mrt' theme, which is not distributed with
      various other packages for legal reasons. The pydance development
      team is looking for people willing to do voice acting for free
      announcer samples! New themes can be installed in
      <tt>themes/dj</tt>.</p></dd>

      <dt>masteroffset [num] (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>Some systems have speakers or displays that take
	  measurable time (in terms of affecting gameplay) to output a
	  signal. If you have one of these, you can add an offset in
      milliseconds to every song you have.</p>
	<p>This should not be used if you have a lot of step files
      that are a specific number of milliseconds off. If you use it
      for this, all new files you get will be wrong, and no one else
      will be able to use your original files.</p></dd>

      <dt>onboardaudio 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Some systems (especially laptops) use sound cards or drivers
      that resample sound in strange ways, which may make pydance play
      songs such that they "drift" in relation to the steps. If you
      seem to be having drifting issues in all the songs you play, you
      should try turning this on.</p></dd>

      <dt>previewmusic 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is on, the song selection screen will play a
      brief sound clip from the middle of the song when you move the
      selector over it.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Interface Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>saveinput 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally when pydance exits it saves your current keymap
      to ~/.pydance/input.cfg (or just input.cfg). Turning this option
      off stops that behavior.</p></dd>

      <dt>sortmode 0|1|2|3 (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>This sets the sorting mode for the song select screen. 0
      sorts by mix, 1 by song name, 2 by artist name, and 3 by BPM.</p>
      <p>This can also be changed by pressing 's' on the song select
      screen.</p></dd>

<dt>folders 1|0</dt>
<dd><p>If you have over 60 songs, and this option is on, pydance will
organize them into "folders" based on your sorting mode in the song
selector.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>System Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>songdir [dir1:dir2:dir] (or on Windows, dir1;dir2;dir3)</dt>
      <dd><p>This is a list of directories where pydance should look for
      songs (.dance files, backgrounds and banners, and the audio
      itself). Generally installing pydance gives you a system-wide
      location to place songs (that all users will have access to),
      and a local one in your home directory.</p></dd>
      <dt>coursedir [dir1:dir2:dir] (or on Windows, dir1;dir2;dir3)</dt>
      <dd><p>This is a list of directories where pydance should look for
      courses (.crs files).
      Installing pydance gives you a system-wide
      location to place courses (that all users will have access to),
      and a local one in your home directory.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Obscure Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>strobe 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Turning this on results in a little blinking light in the
      bottom right corner of the screen. With various light detection
      equipment, this can be used to make pydance communicate with a
      strobe lighting system.</p></dd>

<dt>usepsyco 1|0</dt>
<dd><p>Try to use the Psyco optimizing compiler for Python (<a
href="http://psyco.sf.net">http://psyco.sf.net</a>). This is on by
default, and can give 30-50% speed gains on slower systems. However,
it also uses substantially more memory (which is usually not a
problem, since pydance's code memory footprint is small relative to
its song data). Psyco is currently only available for IA32
systems.</p></dd>

<dt>vesacompat 0|1</dt>
<dd>Try to work on really old broken displays, like svgalib.
Don't ever turn this option on.</dd>

    </dl>
    <h1>Using a Mat</h1>
    <p>The recommended adapter for pydance is the <a
    href="http://levelsix.com/products/pc/EMSUSB2.shtml">EMSUSB2</a>
    from Level Six. pydance easily supports two players with it, and it
    works on all operating systems. Also known to work is the parallel
    port adapter that comes with <a href="http://www.buynshop.com">BNS
    pads</a>. Any other 6 axis, 12 button or 4 axis, 16 button
    joysticks that behave like those two adapters will also work.</p>
<p>If you use a mat, you may need to remap your keyboard or joystick
buttons. From the main menu, go to Interface Options, then Map
    Keys. From here you can rebind your joystick or keyboard
    buttons. In addition, you will need to go here if you plug in a
    joystick while pydance is running; otherwise it will not be
    detected until you restart.</p>
    <h2>GNU/Linux</h2>
    <p>For parallel adapters, you can use the ddrmat.o driver available at
    <a href="http://icculus.org/pyddr/get.php">http://icculus.org/pyddr/get.php</a>
    (which is a modified gamecon.o from the 2.4
    kernel). Once compiled, just run <tt>insmod ddrmat gc=0,7</tt>
    (where 7 is the IRQ of your parallel port, which is probably
    7). Note that your <tt>lp</tt> (parallel printer) module cannot be
    loaded at the same time. The normal gamecon.o module might work too,
    although you may have to rotate your pad 45 degrees.</p>
    <p>USB drivers are much easier. If your kernel has USB joystick
    support, just plug it in and it should work. If it doesn't, make
    sure the input, hid, and joydev modules are loaded (the first two
    are required for any USB input device).</p>
    <h2>Mac OS X</h2>
    <p>Just plug in your pad using the USB adapter, and off you go.
Parallel port adapters are not supported.</p>
    <h2>Windows</h2>
    <p>This OS's hardware support is too unreliable and inconsistent
    to describe the process here. All we can say is "make sure the
    appropriate driver is installed".</p>
    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>As long as <a href="http://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a> supports
    your OS's joysticks, pydance will too. pydance specifically is looking
    for 4 axis 16 button, or 6 axis 12 button joysticks (and also the
    32 button EMSUSB2).</p>
    <h1>Other Programs</h1>
    <h2>findbpm</h2>
    <p>This program plays a song and lets you tap a key along with the
    beat. It averages the number of times you tap over the length of
    the song, and calculates a BPM. This method sounds crude, but if
    you have a good sense of rhythm, it's actually highly
    accurate. Run it using <tt>findbpm song.ogg</tt>.</p>
    <h2>pyjoy</h2>
    <p>This program reports information about your joystick, and lets you
see what button number each button triggers when you press it. Run it from
a terminal.</p>
    <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <p>The FAQ is available online at <a
    href="http://www.icculus.org/pyddr/faq.php">http://www.icculus.org/pyddr/faq.php</a>. Please read it before contacting the developers.</p>
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <p>There are several different ways to get in touch with the pydance
      developers.</p>
    <h2>Email</h2>
    <p>The primary email address is the pyddr-discuss mailing list on
      icculus.org. To subscribe, email <a
    href="mailto:pyddr-discuss-subscribe@icculus.org">pyddr-discuss-subscribe@icculus.org</a>.
    You can then send email to <a
    href="mailto:pyddr-discuss@icculus.org">pyddr-discuss@icculus.org</a>
    to talk about pydance. If you want to see about having pydance at a
    convention or show, contact <a
    href="mailto:tgz@orotech.net">Brendan Becker
    &lt;tgz@orotech.net&gt;</a>, or show up on the IRC channel.</p>
    <h2>IRC</h2>
    <p>If you need a bit more real-time help than email offers, pydance
      has an <acronym title="Internet Relayed Chat">IRC</acronym> channel on
	the <a href="http://www.freenode.net">Freenode IRC
	  network</a>. Surprisingly, the channel is named
	<tt>#pyddr</tt>. The main developers are often in the channel as
	P2E (Brendan) and piman (Joe).</p>
