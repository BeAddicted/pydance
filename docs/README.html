    <h1>About pyDDR</h1>
    <p>pyDDR is a dancing simulator, primarily for GNU/Linux, but it also
      runs on other UNIX-like operating systems, Windows, and Mac OS
      X. DDR stands for "Dance Dance Revolution", a game that's slowly
      earning popularity in the  United States and other countries,
      that comes from Japan. The game idea is simple. There's a mat with
      four directional arrows  you can step on, and the game scrolls
      arrows up the screen while playing a song. When the arrows reach
      the top of the screen (not sooner and not later, since they pass
      over stationary arrows), you hit the corresponding arrow on the
      pad, and given that you hit it on time with the beat, you score
      points. The idea is that the game is supposed to either teach you
      to dance, or simulate dancing. It works to a degree. =]</p>
    <p>However, if you're just hearing about this game (or you're broke), you
      don't actually <em>need</em> a mat to play pyDDR (although it
      definitely makes it more fun). You can use a keyboard or regular
      joystick instead.</p>
    <p>This document assumes you've managed to install pyDDR already.
      If not, you might want to look at the INSTALL file included with
      the source.</p>
    <h1>Playing pyDDR</h1>
    <p>To play the game, just select "Play Game" from the menu and select
      a song. Press j and l to change your difficulty setting
    (more bars means more difficult). Hit enter when you're on a
    difficulty and song you like.</p>
    <p>Oh wait, now there's all these arrows scrolling up the screen -
    what should you do? Actually, it's pretty simple. When the arrows
    get to the top (which is in time with the music), step on the
    direction of the arrow on your pad. If you're using the keyboard,
    you can just IJKL for up/down/left/right.</p>
    <p>If you want to play a versus game, just hit start on the second
    player's dance mat, or '2' on the keyboard; The second player uses
    the arrow keys.</p>
    <p>If you need to exit the game or back out of menus, just press
    escape.</p>
    <h1>Configuring pyDDR</h1>
    <p>The easy way to configure pyDDR is to use the in-game
    configuration menus. Just select the menu item you want to change
    and hit enter or left and right. If you need more precise
    configuration, read on.</p>
    <p>pyDDR reads from configuration files in appropriate
    places. This means <tt>/etc/pyddr.cfg</tt> and
    <tt>~/.pyddr/pyddr.cfg</tt> on UNIX,
    <tt>/Library/Preferences/pyDDR/pyddr.cfg</tt> and
    <tt>~/Library/Preferences/pyDDR/pyddr.cfg</tt> on Mac OS X, and
      <tt>pyddr.cfg</tt> in the current directory on all platforms
    (note that this is the only configuration file Windows systems
    will read). Files are read in the order listed above.</p>
    <h2>Adding Songs</h2>
    <p>To add songs, you just need to put the .step file, music file,
    and (if they exist) background and banner files into one of your
    song directories. This is the <tt>songdir</tt> configuration
    variable. On POSIX systems this is /usr/share/games/pyddr/songs,
    /usr/local/share/games/pyddr/songs, and ~/.pyddr/songs. On
    Windows, this is anywhere in the directory pyDDR was installed
    in. On Mac OS X, this is the 'pyDDR Songs' folder in your Music folder.</p>
    <!-- FIXME - adding themes -->
    <h2>pyddr.cfg</h2>
    <p>There's a ton of options for this program, most of them with
    confusing names. A complete (as of sometime between 0.6.1 and
    0.6.2) list follows.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>arrowcolors 1|2|3|4</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally there are three colors of arrows; one for
      on-beat (quarter notes), one for exactly off-beat (eighth
      notes), and one for all other kinds (16th, 24th, and so on). If
      you change this option, you will only see limited
      colors, which can make the game much harder.</p></dd>

      <dt>assist 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>In this mode, pyDDR will play a sound when you are
      supposed to hit an arrow. It's useful if you can't see the
      screen, or need help getting on beat in a particular
      song.</p></dd>

      <dt>autofail 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is turned off, the game will continue, even when
      your lifebar runs out.</p></dd>

      <dt>badknees 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>If you have trouble with jumps (two arrows at once), you
      can turn this option on to change jumps to one regular
      arrow.</p></dd>

      <dt>grading 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>pyDDR will normally display a grade at the end of every
      song. Turning this option off will bring you back to the song
      selector instead.</p></dd>

      <dt>hidden [num] (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>This makes arrows fade out when they are a certain
      number of beats before the top arrows. You do, however, still
      have to hit them. :)</p></dd>

      <dt>little 0|1|2|3 (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>If you want to try a harder song but want simpler steps,
      you can set this option. 1 removes 16th notes from the song, 2
      removes 8th notes, and 3 removes 16th and 8th notes.</p></dd>

      <dt>lowestcombo [num] (default 4)</dt>
      <dd><p>The number of greats, perfects, or marvelouses you need
      in a row before it begins to count as a "combo" (which affects
      scoring and judging).</p></dd>

      <dt>reversescroll 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally arrows scroll from bottom to top. If this is on,
      they will scroll from top to bottom.</p></dd>

      <dt>scrollspeed [num] (default 1.0)</dt>
      <dd><p>You can use this to make the arrows scroll faster or
      slower (which changes how many are on the screen at any time and
      the spacing between them). It can be a fractional value, like
      0.5 or 1.33.</p></dd>

      <dt>showtoparrows 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>This removes the visual aid of the arrows at the top,
      making you pay more attention to the beat of the music.</p></dd>

      <dt>sudden [num] (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>This makes arrows appear only after they are a certain
      number of beats up the screen. It's the opposite of hidden.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Graphical Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>arrowspin 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>If this option is on, the arrows will spin around in
      circles as they go up the screen.</p></dd>

      <dt>arrowscale [num] (default 1)</dt>
      <dd><p>Arrows normally stay the same size as they go up the
      screen. This option makes them shrink (if it's less than 1) or
      grow (if it's more than 1).</p></dd>

      <dt>bgbrightness [num] (default 127)</dt>
      <dd><p>This option determines how bright the background during
      the song is. Higher numbers mean a brighter background.</p></dd>

      <dt>explodestyle [0|1|2|3] (default 3)</dt>
      <dd><p>pyDDR usually displays an effect if you successfully hit an
      arrow, rotating and scaling the arrow at the top. If this is too
      CPU intensive (or you just don't like it), you can set it to 0
      for no effect, 1 for rotating, 2 for scaling, and 3 for rotating
      and scaling.</p></dd>

      <dt>fpsdisplay 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is on pyDDR will display an FPS counter in the
      corner. See the FAQ for what to do if your FPS is very
      low.</p></dd>

      <dt>gfxtheme [themename]</dt>
      <dd><p>Sets your graphical theme (affecting the look of the arrows
      and your lifebar). pyDDR comes with the 'classic' and 'bryan'
      themes. More themes can be installed by putting them in your
      <tt>themes/gfx</tt> directory.</p></dd>

      <dt>gratuitous 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>This turns on some graphical effects that may slow down the
      game and interface considerably.</p></dd>

      <dt>ingamehelp 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally pyDDR displays some messages about how to use the
	  menus. If these annoy you, turn this off.</p></dd>

      <dt>lyriccolor [color] (default cyan)</dt>
      <dd><p>Set the color that lyrics appear in. Possible values are
      cyan, aqua, yellow, white, black, red, purple, or orange.</p></dd>

      <dt>showbackground 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Many songs in pyDDR and other dancing games have a
      background image that displays when you play them; however, this
      can make the game slightly slower. If you're desperate for more
      frames, try turning this off to remove the background.</p></dd>

      <dt>showcombo 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Normally when you get a combo, pyDDR will display your
      current combo length on the screen. Turning this off will remove
      that display.</p></dd>

      <dt>showlyrics 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Some songs have lyrics or other text that will appear at
      the bottom of the screen. Turning this off will remove those
      lyrics.</p></dd>

      <dt>stickycombo 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is off, your combo is erased from the screen
      after a period of time, even if you don't miss an
      arrow.</p></dd>

      <dt>stickyjudge 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>This is like stickycombo, but for judgings (good,
      marvelous, and so on), rather than your combo.</p></dd>

      <dt>totaljudgings [num] (default 1)</dt>
      <dd><p>This many judgings will be displayed on the screen at a
      time.</p></dd>

      <dt>transcolor [color] (default aqua)</dt>
      <dd><p>The color of the second line of lyrics (the "translated"
      line). Possible colors are the same as the ones for the
      lyriccolor option.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Sound Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>djtheme [themename]</dt>
      <dd><p>Sets your announcer theme. By default pyDDR comes with
      the 'none' theme (no announcer). Copies from the official
      website also have a 'mrt' theme, which is not distributed with
      various other packages for legal reasons. The pyDDR development
      team is looking for people willing to do voice acting for free
      announcer samples! New themes can be installed in
      <tt>themes/dj</tt>.</p></dd>

      <dt>masteroffset [num] (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>Some systems have speakers or displays that take
	  measurable time (in terms of affecting gameplay) to output a
	  signal. If you have one of these, you can add an offset in
      milliseconds to every song you have.</p>
	<p>This should not be used if you have a lot of step files
      that are a specific number of milliseconds off. If you use it
      for this, all new files you get will be wrong, and no one else
      will be able to use your original files.</p></dd>

      <dt>mixerclock 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>Setting this to 0 will make pyDDR use the system clock
      instead of SDL's internal timing functions. This can lead to
      drift between the position in the song and the arrows
      displayed.</p></dd>

      <dt>onboardaudio 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Some systems (especially laptops) use sound cards that
      resample sound in really stupid ways, which may make pyDDR play
      songs such that they "drift" in relation to the steps. If you
      seem to be having drifting issues in all the songs you play, you
      should try turning this on.</p></dd>

      <dt>previewmusic 1|0</dt>
      <dd><p>If this is on, the song selection screen will play a
      brief sound clip from the middle of the song when you move the
      selector over it.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Interface Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>keyboard qwerty|rqwerty|dvorak|rdvorak</dt>
      <dd><p>Your keyboard type. 'ijkl', while convenient on qwerty
      (standard) keyboards, doesn't work at all on dvorak
      ones. Setting this option to dvorak will redefine your keys to
      'chtn'. The "r" variants swap controls (so player 1 uses the
      arrows, and player 2 uses the letters).</p></dd>

      <dt>sortmode 0|1|2|3|4|5 (default 0)</dt>
      <dd><p>This sets the sorting mode for the song select screen. 0
      sorts by filename, 1 by song name, 2 by artist name, 3 by BPM, 4
      by difficulty, and 5 by mix.</p>
      <p>This can also be changed by pressing 's' on the song select
      screen.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>System Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>songdir [dir1:dir2:dir] (or on Windows, dir1;dir2;dir3)</dt>
      <dd><p>This is a list of directories where pyDDR should look for
      songs (.step files, backgrounds and banners, and the audio
      itself). Generally installing pyDDR gives you a system-wide
      location to place songs (that all users will have access to),
      and a local one in your home directory.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Obscure Options</h3>
    <dl class="options">
      <dt>strobe 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>Turning this on results in a little blinking light in the
      bottom right corner of the screen. With various light detection
      equipment, this can be used to make pyDDR communicate with a
      strobe lighting system.</p></dd>

      <dt>vesacompat 0|1</dt>
      <dd><p>This makes pyDDR (try to) work with the old, buggy, obsolete
	  SVGAlib library and drivers on UNIX.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h1>Using a Mat</h1>
    <p>The recommended adapter for pyDDR is the <a
    href="http://levelsix.com/products/pc/EMSUSB2.shtml">EMSUSB2</a>
    from Level Six. pyDDR easily supports two player with it, and it
    works on all operating systems. Also known to work is the parallel
    port adapter that comes with <a href="http://www.buynshop.com">BNS
    pads</a>. Any other 6 axis, 12 button or 4 axis, 16 button
    joysticks that behave like those two adapters will also work.</p>
    <h2>GNU/Linux</h2>
    <p>For parallel adapters, you can use the ddrmat.o driver available at
    <a href="http://icculus.org/pyddr/get.php">http://icculus.org/pyddr/get.php</a>
    (which is a modified gamecon.o from the 2.4
    kernel). Once compiled, just run <tt>insmod ddrmat gc=0,7</tt>
    (where 7 is the IRQ of your parallel port, which is probably
    7). Note that your <tt>lp</tt> (parallel printer) module cannot be
    loaded at the same time. The normal gamecon.o module may work too,
    although you may have to rotate your pad 45 degrees.</p>
    <p>USB drivers are much easier. If your kernel has USB joystick
    support, just plug it in and it should work. If it doesn't, make
    sure the input, hid, and joydev modules are loaded (the first two
    are required for any USB input device).</p>
    <h2>Mac OS X</h2>
    <p>Plug-and-play, or so I've heard. Just plug in your pad using
    the USB adapter, and off you go.</p>
    <h2>Windows</h2>
    <p>This OS's hardware support is too unreliable and inconsistent
    to describe the process here. All we can say is "make sure the
    appropriate driver is installed".</p>
    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p>As long as <a href="http://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a> supports
    your OS's joysticks, pyDDR will too. pyDDR specifically is looking
    for 4 axis 16 button, or 6 axis 12 button joysticks (and also the
    32 button EMSUSB2).</p>
    <h1>Other Programs</h1>
    <p>pyDDR comes with a handful of miscellaneous programs to
    manipulate its step file format, and to help time songs.</p>
    <h2>dwi2step, msd2step, and step2dwi</h2>
    <p>These programs convert to and from the popular MSD and DWI file
    formats. Just run <tt>dwi2step file.dwi</tt> and it should convert
    the file nicely. If a DWI file works in Dance With Intensity but
    not after conversion, let us know.</p>
    <h2>findbpm</h2>
    <p>This program plays a song and lets you tap a key along with the
    beat. It averages the number of times you tap over the length of
    the song, and calculates a BPM. This method sounds crude, but if
    you have a good sense of rhythm, it's actually highly
    accurate. Run it using <tt>findbpm song.ogg</tt>.</p>
    <h2>lyrictag</h2>
    <p>This program helps you add lyrics to step files. To run it, use
    <tt>lyrictag -s song.ogg -l lyrics.txt -o song.step</tt>. When the
      highlighted lyric is said in the song, press space to advance
    the display. If you press a key too early, press backspace to go
    back in the list.</p>
    <p>lyrictag will not overwrite lyrics already in a file, so you
    need to open up the step file and delete the LYRICS section if you
    want to add new lyrics.</p>
    <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <p>The old FAQ is currently at <a
    href="http://www.icculus.org/pyddr/faq.php">http://www.icculus.org/pyddr/faq.php</a>. Eventually that will be replaced with this one.</p>
    <dl class="faq">
      <dt>My MP3 fails to load.</dt>
      <dd><p>pyDDR's MP3 support comes via the SMPEG, which is
      suboptimal, but integrates with SDL's mixer library
      easily. You have three options. The first is to try stripping
      ID3 tags from your MP3 files; you can do this in UNIX with <a
      href="http://www.dakotacom.net/~donut/programs/id3ed.html">id3ed</a>
      for regular ID3 tags, or <a
      href="http://www.geocities.com/matsp888/unix/">v2strip</a> for
      ID3v2 tags, On Mac OS X, you can use <a
      href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/16665">Taggerwocky</a>.
      Secondly, you can convert them to the <a
      href="http://www.vorbis.com">Ogg Vorbis</a> format. <a
      href="http://faceprint.com/code/">mp32ogg</a> can do this
      nicely. The third possibility is to merge <a
      href="http://spacepants.org/src/pymad/">pymad</a> support into
      pyDDR, and send us the patches.</p></dd>
      <dt>pyDDR keeps crashing with a "KeyError". How do I fix it?</dt>
      <dd><p>The format of some options in pyddr.cfg changes
      periodically. This should no longer be a problem after 0.6.2
      because the file is kept to a minimum, and the changes are made
      in the source itself. However, if you are upgrading from an
      older version to 0.6.2, you may need to delete your
      configuration file and have pyDDR recreate it.</p></dd>
      <dt>My soft mat sucks. Can I improve it?</dt>
      <dd><p>Yes, you can 'convert' a soft mat into a hard mat in a
      number of ways. One popular, simple, and fast way is to buy some
      plywood and staple-gun some vinyl hardwood-floor covering to the
      board over your DDR mat. Another thing you can do is take your
      soft mat apart and reenforce it with extra foam, wood, and
      sheet metal. One of the pyDDR developers has written a <a
      href="http://clickass.org/~tgz/pyddr/hardmat/">guide on doing
      this</a>.</p></dd>
      <dt>I bought this adapter from Radio Shack, and...</dt>
      <dd><p>Take it back, now. The Radio Shack adapter works by
      mapping the up/down/left/right button to the X and Y joystick
      axes. This means that it can only read one of up/down or
      left/right at the same time (that is, jumps are impossible, and
      leaving your foot on an opposite arrow is also
      impossible). Besides the recommended <a
      href="http://levelsix.com/products/pc/EMSUSB2.shtml">EMSUSB2</a>
	  adapter, pyDDR
      should work on anything that maps the directional arrows to
      buttons. Make sure your adapter does that.</p></dd>
      <dt>Why do I get weird colors or graphic artifacts?</dt>
      <dd><p>You may be running 8 or 24 bit color. pyDDR shouldn't
      actually run at 8 bit color at all, and it's not supported. The
      issues with 24 bit color should be fixed; contact the developers
      with a bug report if they're not.</p></dd>
      <dt>Why doesn't pyDDR use DWI files?</dt>
      <dd><p>Because it's not called Dance With Intensity. :) More
      realistically, it's because it was easier to write a new file
      format than support DWI's (whose documentation is lacking)
      initially. Also, since pyDDR has no step editor yet, it was
      necessary to have a format that was human readable.</p>
	<p>Right now, you can use <tt>dwi2step</tt> to convert DWIs to
      pyDDR's .step format. In a future version, pyDDR will be able to
      read from DWI files without conversion.</p></dd>
      <dt>While I was building SMPEG, I got undefined symbol problems.</dt>
      <dd><p>If you're using gcc 3.2, you may need to add these
      <kbd>-lgcc_s and -lsupc++</kbd> to the compilation
      options.</p></dd>
      <dt>pyDDR is way, way too slow.</dt>
      <dd><p>There's no "answer" to this - the program needs
      work. However, there are a couple of things you can try.</p>
	<ul><li>Turn off backgrounds, and arrow explosions. These
      often make the biggest difference performance-wise.</li>
	  <li>Switch from 24 bit to 16 bit color. This greatly
      increases the frame rate on many computers.</li>
	  <li>Run pyDDR in fullscreen mode. It has to deal with less
      refresh events in such a case.</li>
	  <li>Upgrade your video card. pyDDR is very video-intensive;
      a high-powered processor with a bad video card will perform
      terribly.</li>
	</ul></dd>
      <dt>What about adding &lt;insert feature here&gt;?</dt>
      <dd><p>If that feature is one of the following, you have
      incurred our wrath: OpenGL support, internet play. Otherwise, we
      almost certainly have it planned already. If you have some
      "great new idea" for pyDDR that already exists in regular DDR,
      you can also enjoy our wrath.</p></dd>
    </dl>
    <h1>Contacts</h1>
    <p>There are several different ways to get in touch with the pyDDR
      developers.</p>

      has an <acronym title="Internet Relayed Chat">IRC</acronym> channel on
	the <a href="http://www.freenode.net">Freenode IRC
	  network</a>. Surprisingly, the channel is named
