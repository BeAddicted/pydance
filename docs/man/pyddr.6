.TH pyddr 6 "March 28th, 2003"
.SH NAME
pyddr \- a Dance Dance Revolution simulator using Pygame
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpyddr
.SH DESCRIPTION
pyDDR is much like the popular arcade game "Dance Dance Revolution", in
which you stand on a mat on the floor, with 4 buttons pointing forward,
backwards, left, and right. Arrows scroll across the screen, and you must
step on the arrows on the mat when they reach the top. These steps
happen in time with music in the background, causing a rough approximation
of dancing.
.PP
pyDDR supports most of the features of similar games, such as background
and banner images for each song, multiple difficulty levels, freeze
arrows (arrows you have to remain standing on for a length of time),
and lyric display. pyDDR also allows you to use a real DDR mat if you have
a Playstation to PC joystick adapter supported by ddrmat kernel module (which
is a modified version of the gamecon kernel module), or a Playstation to
USB joystick adapter and the USB joystick driver. If you lack a mat, you
can play on the keyboard using the arrows as well, but it's much less fun.
.PP
You can also make your own step files to new music. \fIstepfile.txt\fR
included with pyDDR documents the format, or you can use the program
\fBinstep\fR(1).
.SH FILES
.IP /usr/share/games/pyddr/songs,\ /usr/local/share/games/pyddr/songs,\ ~/.pyddr/songs
By default, pyDDR will look in these directories for your songs, step files,
and other game data. You can configure this with the \fBsongdir\fR
option in your pyddr.cfg file.
.IP /etc/pyddr.cfg,\ ~/.pyddr/pyddr.cfg
pyDDR configuration files. The settings in your local one override
the system-wide settings.
.IP /usr/share/games/pyddr
Various data needed by pyDDR, such as background music and Python modules.
