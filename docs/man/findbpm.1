.TH findbpm 1 "January 16th, 2003"
.SH NAME
findbpm \- average keypresses over the length of a song to find the BPM
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfindbpm \fIsong.ogg\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script plays a song file (in Ogg Vorbis or MP3 format) and lets you
tap along on the spacebar, calculating the BPM (beats per minute) in the
song as you go. It also gives you an offset in milliseconds of when
you started tapping, compared to when the song started. You can then
use these two values to create a step file for that song (see
the documentation on the step format in
\fI/usr/share/doc/pyddr/stepfile.txt\fR).
.SH BUGS
This is only as accurate as your sense of rhythm. :)
