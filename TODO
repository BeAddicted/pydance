This is my (piman's) rough outline of where I want to be. Other people,
add to it.

0.6.3
 - Have installer files for Mac OS X.
 - better help in game (context-sensitive menu help, key maps)
 - Clean up the main select/dance/judge loop. (3/4th done)
 - Player-as-object patch
   - Removal of keykludge
 - Separate Song (makes arrow events out of patterns), and SongFile.
   (loads file, gets metadata, creates Song given a difficulty)
   - Removes fastSong (done)
   - 'Song' removal probably not until 0.6.4?
 - New song select (done)
 - Themable menus?
 - Support A2B8 pads.

0.6.4
 - DWI loader natively using the SongFile interface.

Misc:
md5 checksums in .step files for the music they go with (wait for rewrite)
