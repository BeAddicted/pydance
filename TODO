A Comprehensive List of Features for pydance 1.2
(with ideas on how to do them)
------------------------------------------------

* UI Rework
   Not really the extent that I reworked it between 0.8 and 0.9,
   but tweak the existing ones, space them better, add more
   animation/fading/etc. This is kind of a vague goal, but I
   think at this point the UI should be developed iteratively.

* MP3 Support
   Pyxine, pymad, or waiting for libavcodec support in Pygame are
   all options here. Note that Pyxine doesn't give enough timing
   resolution by itself.

* Hold Arrow Behavior
   You should have to start holding arrows roughly when they start; in
   the current version, you can just hold them down starting any time,
   and it counts.

* Automatic handling of different step ratings
   This needs changes to the grading screen (to display them) and to
   the JudgingDisplay code, to handle them.

* Hold Arrow Drawing
   Hold arrows should be split into three images, the top, the
   repeating/stretched part, and the bottom. This requires some
   big changes to all the themes, though.

* A Free Announcer & Script
   The announcer has to say at least one thing for each grade, a
   dozen or so possibilities during song (preferrably around 30
   or 40), and a few things for song selection.

* Cleanup & Port to Python 2.3
  - Replace a lot of 'i in range(len(x))' with 'i,o in enumerate(x)'.
  - See if "string" in otherstring will help anywhere.
  - Port pydance.log hackery to a Logger object!

* Different game types for each player
   This is the biggest feature I want. Have a game type list (rather
   than single argument) passed to dance.play, probably in the
   playlist itself. The real trick is making a sane UI for this.

* Modifiers in courses
   This requires players to reevaluate their modifiers between songs,
   which shouldn't be too difficult. It might even half-work for some
   modifiers already, but I haven't tested anything.

* Combat (Disney-style / Dance Magic / Magic Dance) versus
   This needs basically the same as the above, but player modifiers
   need to be able to change even within songs (of course, if that
   works, so does the above).

* Challenge mode
   This can probably be done in lifebars for various forms, or strange
   Stats objects that will affect gameplay.  

* Song Library
   Sort of like DDR Max 2 USA, the idea is to have a database of songs
   where you can just listen to them, or view information (like
   DESCRIPTION) about them. Bonus points if you can watch the step
   charts in the background or something.

* BG Animation
   This is probably a Sprite like BGMovie is now, but with complicated
   timing information about when to change. For good support of
   existing SM/DWI animations, we'll need avcodec support.

* 4 Player Mode
   A lot of things in the pydance code assume 2 players. I like to
   think a lot doesn't too (I tried to generalize where possible), but
   it's all untested and I know there's a lot of work to do here.

* Fix main menu code
   390 lines of code are spent on the main menu, which is a million
   times simpler than any other UI in the game.

* Fix endless mode
   The UI is so ugly.

* FIXME: There are a lot of FIXMEs in the code. Some of them get
  obsoleted over time, but most will still need fixing.
