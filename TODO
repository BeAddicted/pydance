This is my (piman's) rough outline of where I want to be. Other people,
add to it.

0.6.3
 - FIX ARROW COUNTING BUG - at least as far back as 0.6.1
 - Have installer files for Mac OS X.
 - better help in game (sort of done)
 - Clean up the main select/dance/judge loop. (3/4th done)
 - Player-as-object patch (in progress)
   - Removal of keykludge (yay!)
 - Separate Song (makes arrow events out of patterns), and SongFile.
   (loads file, gets metadata, creates Song given a difficulty)
   - Removes fastSong (done)
 - New song select (done)
 - Support A2B8 pads (need more info...)

0.6.4
 - Removal of Song
  - Replace with "Steps" object in the Player object
   - Generated from SongItem
 - Standardization on the forthcoming ".dance" format.

0.6.x
 - High score files (0.6.4?)
 - Savable courses (0.6.4?)
 - Endless (0.6.3?) - Yes
 - DWI loader natively using the SongItem interface
 - Sort by popularity (uses high score mechanism)
 - Themable menus
 - Credits screen
 - MD5 checksums in files for the music they go with

UI changes (doable at any time):
 - Go faster after scrolling through a few songs
 - Up/down indicators on menus

Far Future:
 - More game modes
 - Menu and song select theming (including new songselect.pys)

Ideas from pyddr.txt:
---------------------
option for classic or new (pyddr/ddrmax) judging style on jumps
jump to song (we *need* either this, or submenu song selects)

STUFF ANNOUNCER SHOULD SAY
--------------------------
<hardcore`> "Awful dancing, you dance like gaijin"
<hardcore`> "get off the mat, there are crippled people waiting to put you
to shame"
<Futility> "You shame your ancestors with that feeble twitching!"
<hardcore`> "Are you awake, you suck at dancing"  "Are your legs broken?"
<ShredWheat> "stick to programming!"
<ShredWheat> "don't quit that day job"
<Futility> Hehe. "All your peers dance better than you! You are no better
than a white person!"

NEAT STUFF
----------
<ShredWheat> pixels = pygame.surfarray.pixels2d(image)
<ShredWheat> pixels ^= pygame.surfarray.pixels2d(alpha_image)

<ShredWheat> img_array = pygame.surfarray.pixels3d(img)
<ShredWheat> img_array[...,0] = img_array[...,2] = img_array[...,1]

NOTES ON THE SOURCE
-------------------
(We need to verify this and remove parts that aren't true anymore):
res 640x480 (fullscreen adjustable?)

arrows 64x64: 512W with 12Wx8 gaps: 608. 32W gap in center.

arrow gfx filenaming convention:
arr_X_TYPE_FRAME, where TYPE is direction (L,D,U,R) and X is
  N: normal
  S: stepped on
  C: colored

FRAME is 0123 for normal/stepped for arrow pulsing, or 012 for colors

status of arrows:

arrstat(x,y,z) = status where status is:
  0 = no status / not initialised
  1 = is shown (if game is in "sudden" or something, this will help)
  2 = has pulse (to beat)
  4 = has step (they hit this arrow)

  8 = is an arrow (blue 4ths, red 8ths, green 16ths - autocalc'ed)
 16 =
 32 =
 64 = hold end
128 = hold begin

x = 0,1,2,3 = l,d,u,r
y = row position (0 = top)
z = player (1 left, 2 right)
toparrows are still in arrstat (y=0)
