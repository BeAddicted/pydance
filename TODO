Required for 1.0
----------------
Empty "Bugs" section of BUGS file.
Best grades stored.
Real documentation for end-users.
Some sort of documentation for theme and step making (it can be crappy).
Funky credits screen.
At least some minor in-game help.
Better graphics in the course selection screen.
No crashes or major bugs for 5 days after the last CVS check in.

Before 1.0 If "Time"
--------------------
Proper DMX and EZ2 support...
  (DMX will be removed if the graphics don't shape up)
Different game types for each player.
Modifiers in courses (this is pretty high priority).
Player's Best/Worst
Announcer. Really. Look hard.

Definitely Not Touching Until After 1.0
---------------------------------------
Song/game selector merge/rewrite -- looks sort of like IIDX, mockups
  coming before implementation.
Less ugly grading screen (like, a real grading screen).
Combat (Disney-style) versus.
Challenge mode.
4 players / 2 player doubles for some modes.
Player profiles, if deemed necessary.
Song information database.
Background animation support.

STUFF ANNOUNCER SHOULD SAY
--------------------------
<hardcore`> "Awful dancing, you dance like gaijin"
<hardcore`> "get off the mat, there are crippled people waiting to put you
to shame"
<Futility> "You shame your ancestors with that feeble twitching!"
<hardcore`> "Are you awake, you suck at dancing"  "Are your legs broken?"
<ShredWheat> "stick to programming!"
<ShredWheat> "don't quit that day job"
<Futility> Hehe. "All your peers dance better than you! You are no better
than a white person!"
