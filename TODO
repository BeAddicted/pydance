This is my (piman's) rough outline of where I want to be. Other people,
add to it.

0.6.2
 - Make pyddr.py use constants.py, new input manager, new menus. (merged)
 - Clean up the main select/dance/judge loop. (better)
 - A release we can safely use for demos, packages, etc. (will be!)

0.6.3
 - better help in game (context-sensitive menu help, key maps)
 - Player-as-object patch (possible 0.6.2).
 - Extend constants.py to cover themes directories. (done in a better way)
 - Make theme-finding use rscdir (rsc_path?) and pyddr_path. (merged)

0.6.4
 - Separate Song (makes arrow events out of patterns), and SongFile.
   (loads file, gets metadata, creates Song given a difficulty)
   - This should remove fastSong.
   - Possible 0.6.3.
 - DWI loader natively using the SongFile interface.

Misc:
md5 checksums in .step files for the music they go with (wait for rewrite)
new song select screen
