Bugs:
-----
Random results in bad hold arrows.
Some arrows occassionally "black square" rather than explode?
Hold arrows don't have a grace period.
Hold arrows are drawn poorly.

General:
--------
Our MP3 support is ass.
We need a way to set the volume in pyao.
We need a real BTS.

THE FACT THAT ESCAPE IN ENDLESS TAKES YOU TO THE NEXT SONG IS NOT A BUG.
STOP REPORTING IT.
