Bugs:
-----
Random results in bad hold arrows.
Hold arrows are drawn poorly.

General:
--------
Our MP3 support is ass.
We need a real BTS.

THE FACT THAT ESCAPE IN ENDLESS TAKES YOU TO THE NEXT SONG IS NOT A BUG.
STOP REPORTING IT.

The whole UI will be getting a rewrite eventually. Rewriting the entire
UI is a lot of work. Unless you're willing to help (as in, code or
graphics), don't report things you don't like about the UI as bugs.
