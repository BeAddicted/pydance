pyDDR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------

pyDDR currently is known to run on Windows, UNIX and GNU/Linux, and
MacOS X systems. In theory, it will run anywhere Pygame and Python do.
pyDDR can be gotten from http://www.icculus.org/pyddr.

In all installations, you need the following things:
 - A sufficiently recent SDL.
 - The [currently] latest SDL_mixer (1.2.5).
 - SMPEG, if you want MP3 support.
 - Libvorbis, if you want Ogg Vorbis support (you need this or SMPEG).
 - Python 2.2 or higher (2.1 is NOT new enough anymore).
 - Pygame 1.5.5 or higher.

If you are running a UNIX distribution, all these probably come with
your OS. Otherwise, you can find them at http://www.libsdl.org,
http://www.xiph.org, http://www.python.org, and http://www.pygame.org.

Installing under UNIX or GNU/Linux
----------------------------------
 $ python setup.py
 $ su -c 'make install'

The first step checks to make sure you have appropriate versions of
Python and Pygame installed. The second one copies files into the
appropriate places on your system (according to the FHS).

If you need to install it somewhere else, you can set DESTDIR (to
install to an alternate root entirely), or PREFIX (which is /usr/local
by default).

The default configuration file looks in /usr/share/games/pyddr/songs,
/usr/local/share/games/pyddr/songs, and ~/.pyddr/songs for Ogg/MP3
and step files.

Installing under Windows
------------------------
 X:\pyddr> python setup.py

That's it. Copy your song and step files to the same directory as pyDDR,
or to a ..\songs directory.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you are having trouble with pyDDR, first check your OS distributor
for updates. Debian and Gentoo GNU/Linux both have packages for pyDDR,
and this is the recommended installation method for these systems.
Also, visit http://www.icculus.org/pyddr and see if a new version has
been released, or if there is a package for your platform. If that
fails, drop by #pyddr on irc.freenode.net and see if anyone knows how
to help you. However, if you ask for help, expect to answer a lot of
questions about your OS and the software on it.
